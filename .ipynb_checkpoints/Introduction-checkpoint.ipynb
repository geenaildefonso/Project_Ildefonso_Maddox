    "We have received Vanderbilt hospital data extracted from the Synthetic Derivative. At Vanderbilt, bioinformaticians helped to create a \"mirror image\" of electronic medical records such as those in BioVU, Vanderbilt's biorepository of DNA extracted from discarded blood collected during routine clinical testing. This mirror of the EMR is called the Synthetic Derivative, and it contains over 2 million individual patients with all clinical information available for the past 10 years. It has been scrubbed of HIPAA identifiers with an eror rate of ~0.01%, meaning that the data has been deidentified with a subject ID. \n",

    "The objective of this project is to employ modeling tools introduced in class to fit prediction models for patient readmission within 30 days of discharge using given data. The data includes multiple variables, detailed below in \"Data.\" Ideally, our model will be able to well predict readmission within 30 days of discharge for a patient using the admit/discharge/transfer events data. The rest of the data detials information about the patients themselves, tests and treatments they underwent at Vanderbilt, and lab results and medication. Using these variables, we hope to accurately predict readmission. This information could be very useful for actually clinicians hoping to predict which patients may need to be readmitted, and which characteristics/tests cause them to be readmitted. Once this is determined, that subset of patients could be given more attention and/or tests to prevent readmission."

    "This project will introduce several approaches to predictive modeling of patient readmission within 30 days of discharge. Three approaches are detailed in the following jupyter notebooks, each of which may include more than one modeling type, attempts to improve each model and test performance, and tuning of the models to increase the goodness of fit. Cross-validation will be used when appropriate, and model selection methods and/or explanations of the models chosen will be provided for each notebook. We will then justify and describe each model selection, and provide visualizations and discussions of the results. The models will be compared using goodness of fit tests and other performance characteristics. For clarification, the steps for each model notebook are listed below, and enumerated in the following 3 modeling notebooks. \n",

To make a large dataset with all of the information we want to include for modeling, we will add data from the other datasets using the dates in those data sets. We will parse the other data sets (for example, BMI), by date (Date_BMI). For each event in the BMI dataset, we will find the matching patient by ID. We will then find the correct column by comparing the date of the measurement (Date_BMI) to the Admission date and Discharge date in each row for that patient (i.e., adding the BMI measurement to the column where the patient ID matches and Admission_date $\\leq$ Date_BMI $\\leq$ Discharge_date.)"
