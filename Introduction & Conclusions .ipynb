    "We have received Vanderbilt hospital data extracted from the Synthetic Derivative. At Vanderbilt, bioinformaticians helped to create a \"mirror image\" of electronic medical records such as those in BioVU, Vanderbilt's biorepository of DNA extracted from discarded blood collected during routine clinical testing. This mirror of the EMR is called the Synthetic Derivative, and it contains over 2 million individual patients with all clinical information available for the past 10 years. It has been scrubbed of HIPAA identifiers with an eror rate of ~0.01%, meaning that the data has been deidentified with a subject ID. \n",

    "The objective of this project is to employ modeling tools introduced in class to fit prediction models for patient readmission within 30 days of discharge using given data. The data includes multiple variables, detailed below in \"Data.\" Ideally, our model will be able to well predict readmission within 30 days of discharge for a patient using the admit/discharge/transfer events data. The rest of the data detials information about the patients themselves, tests and treatments they underwent at Vanderbilt, and lab results and medication. Using these variables, we hope to accurately predict readmission. This information could be very useful for actually clinicians hoping to predict which patients may need to be readmitted, and which characteristics/tests cause them to be readmitted. Once this is determined, that subset of patients could be given more attention and/or tests to prevent readmission."

    "This project will introduce several approaches to predictive modeling of patient readmission within 30 days of discharge. Three approaches are detailed in the following jupyter notebooks, each of which may include more than one modeling type, attempts to improve each model and test performance, and tuning of the models to increase the goodness of fit. Cross-validation will be used when appropriate, and model selection methods and/or explanations of the models chosen will be provided for each notebook. We will then justify and describe each model selection, and provide visualizations and discussions of the results. The models will be compared using goodness of fit tests and other performance characteristics. For clarification, the steps for each model notebook are listed below, and enumerated in the following 3 modeling notebooks. \n",

In other words, the admission and discharge dates are repeated on multiple rows for the same stay: at least two rows (one for admit and one for discharge) but possibly more, depending on the number of transfers.

Thus, each patient ID may be repeated for multiple rows, depending on how often they were admitted, but each visit should only be recorded once in its own row. To make a large dataset with all of the information we want to include for modeling, we will add data from the other datasets using the dates in those data sets. We will parse the other data sets (for example, BMI), by date (Date_BMI). For each event in the BMI dataset, we found the matching patient by ID. We then found the correct column by comparing the date of the measurement (Date_BMI) to the Admission date and Discharge date in each row for that patient (i.e., adding the BMI measurement to the column where the patient ID matches and Admission_date $\\leq$ Date_BMI $\\leq$ Discharge_date.)"

    "The phenotype dataset had data on every patient (8000); however, many of the other datasets are missing data. Some of the columns may be missing data due to error, or missing because the patient didn't have a certain test/procedure done. We decided to use the mean of each variable to impute the missing data below. Our justification is that the measurements with missing data are generally assumed to be normal (BMI, blood pressure, and EGFR), and thus imputation with the mean of the available data is a reasonable guess (most probabilistic guess). It wouldn't make sense to exclude the data, because many patients are missing data (especially BMI data; that dataset is only a tenth of the full patient list). It also wouldn't make sense to impute 0 or some other subjectively chosen number, because in many cases the expected number is not known to us (EGFR?), and cannot be 0 (BMI, blood pressure). Thus, the data itself is used to impute the missing data; since the dataset is so large, we feel that this is a reasonable approach."

For each patient, we ran a for loop through the rows. Each row has a different discharge date, and this date was compared to all of the other admission dates to see if any admission dates were within 30 days of the discharge. If there is such a date, the loop is broken, the patient received a \"1\" value for a \"readmitted\" variable, and the next patient is investigated. This will give us a binary variable corresponding to the patients that were readmitted within 30 days at least once at any time. When building our models, we can use this information to check the accuracy of our models and for cross-validation."

    "The objective of this course project was to employ modeling tools introduced in this course to fit prediction models for patient readmission within 30 days of discharge using synthetic derivative data. In accomplishing this goal of building these predictive models, we chose to imploy a Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. In summary below, we discuss the best model from each predictive model, and the overall best model for this patient readmission data. \n",
    "\n",
    "DTC/RFC:\n",
    "The DTC did an okay job at being able to predict the actual values per patient for probability of readmission within 30 days into the Vanderbilt Hospital. This classifier performed more accurately in being able to predict if a patient was note readmitted within 30 days, as opposed to being readmitted. This classifier deemed the top node of most important feature to be the egfr standard deviation, which came at a suprise to us. We intially thought that the bmi would have been the highest rank in feature importance, and after running the RFC, the highest feature was also the egfr standard deviation. This model did perform the best with an accuracy score of 77%. We both agreed that the RFC was the best choice in models, because it is suited well for this kind of data, starting at a specific point, and asking questions giving answers that lead to subsequent questions. This model is able to split the data that we have into smaller segments, and is able to predict based on the importance of each feature the probability of a patient being readmitted within 30 days into the Vanderbilt Hospital. \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression:\n",
    "The Logistic Regression was the second best model in being able to predict the readmission rates for patients. This type of modeling is good for being able to split data into classes, here with one class being True for readmission into the hospital within 30 days, and the other class beign False for readmission into the hospital within 30 days. Initially trying the default paramters for C being 1, this actually performed the best with the highest accuracy score of 74%. Tuning the parameters of the model did not seem to perform better, all of them averaged around 72% accuracy. Here as well, we utilized the feature importance from the RFC to use as a plotting estimator for the Logistic Regression. In splitting the data predictions using the systolic blood pressure standard deviation and egfr standard deviation, you can visualize the split for True and False values based on the data. This showed to have better precision in predicting that a patient was readmitted to be True, as opposed to the lesser in predicting that a patietn was not being readmitted within 30 days. \n",
    "\n",
    "SVM:\n",
    "Support vector machines are useful in this problem because they work well in high dimensional spaces, and we have multiple variables that we want to use to predict readmission. The best SVM was using an RBF kernel with gamma = 100 and C = 0. This had the best accuracy and precision, but a very low recall score due to high number of false negatives. Most of the patients are negative, so this bias makes sense. We do not believe we overfit the data. With the messiness of the data and the data imputation that we had to do, we think this suggests that the accuracy of the model without overfitting will not be able to reach 100%, and therefore 73% accuracy with high precision is pretty good."
