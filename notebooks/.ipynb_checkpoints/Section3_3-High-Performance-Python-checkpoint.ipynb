    "\n",
    "For a variable in C, the compiler knows the type by its very definition. For a variable in Python, all you know at the time the program executes is that it's some sort of Python object.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you write the following in C:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "int a = 1;\n",
    "int b = 2;\n",
    "int c = a + b;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "the C compiler knows from the start that a and b are integers: they simply can't be anything else! With this knowledge, it can call the routine which adds two integers, returning another integer which is just a simple value in memory. As a rough schematic, the sequence of events looks like this:\n",

    "here the interpreter knows only that 1 and 2 are objects, but not what type of object they are. So the The interpreter must inspect PyObject_HEAD for each variable to find the type information, and then call the appropriate summation routine for the two types. Finally it must create and initialize a new Python object to hold the return value. The sequence of events looks roughly like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "We saw above one difference between interpreted and compiled code. A smart compiler can look ahead and optimize for repeated or unneeded operations, which can result in speed-ups.

    "### Python's object model can lead to inefficient memory access\n",

    "We saw above the extra type info layer when moving from a C integer to a Python integer. Now imagine you have many such integers and want to do some sort of batch operation on them. In Python you might use the standard List object, while in C you would likely use some sort of buffer-based array.\n",
    "\n",
    "A NumPy array in its simplest form is a Python object build around a C array. That is, it has a pointer to a contiguous data buffer of values. A Python list, on the other hand, has a pointer to a contiguous buffer of pointers, each of which points to a Python object which in turn has references to its data (in this case, integers). This is a schematic of what the two might look like:\n",

    "\n",
    "[`numexpr`](http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/) allows array expressions to be evaluated far faster that what can be achieved in Python using Numpy arrays. `numexpr` parses a string expression and optimizes and compiles the code on the fly, using a virtual machine that includes a [Just-in-time (JIT) compiler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation). In addition, `numexpr` offers direct support for parallel multi-threaded computations, since Python's global interpreter lock is bypassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python's global interpreter lock (GIL) ensures that only one thread runs in the interpreter at once. This simplifies many of the low-level activities, such as memory management, and allows for co-operative multi-tasking. But, since the currently-running thread holds onto the interpreter, it makes multi-core parallelization difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part the reason Python can be slow for array calculations is that it creates temporary arrays to store intermediate results from array element calculations, which wastes memory and cache. `numexpr` handles such calculations in manageable chunks, which accellerates computation.\n",
    "\n",

    "The decorators for `trapez5` are **compiler directives** that alter the behavior of Cython code. Setting `boundscheck` to False removes boundary checking for indexing operations, forcing us to ensure that we do not try to index arrays using index vlaues that are out of bounds. When we set `wraparound` to False, Cython will not support negative indexes, as is the case with Python. While these directives may increase the speed of our code, it can be dangerous; if we do not ensure that we index our arrays properly, it may cause segmentation faults or data corruption.\n",
